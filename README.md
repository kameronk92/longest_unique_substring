# Challenge: Longest Unique Substring

## Problem

Write a function `longest_substring_without_repeating` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Examples

1. **Input:** `"abcabcbb"`  
   **Output:** `3`  
   (The longest substring without repeating characters is `"abc"`, with a length of `3`.)

2. **Input:** `"bbbbb"`  
   **Output:** `1`  
   (The longest substring without repeating characters is `"b"`, with a length of `1`.)

3. **Input:** `"pwwkew"`  
   **Output:** `3`  
   (The longest substring without repeating characters is `"wke"`, with a length of `3`.)

### Constraints

- You can assume that the input string only contains ASCII characters.
- The solution should have a time complexity better than O(n^2).

## Task

Implement the function `longest_substring_without_repeating` in Ruby and test it with different test cases to verify its correctness.
